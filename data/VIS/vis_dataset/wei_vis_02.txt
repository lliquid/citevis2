title: Simulating Fire With Texture Splats
authors: Xiaoming Wei, Wei Li, Klaus Mueller, Arie Kaufman
abstract: We propose the use of textured splats as the basic display primitives for an open surface fire model. The high-detail textures help to achieve a smooth boundary of the fire and gain the small-scale turbulence appearance. We utilize the Lattice Boltzmann Model (LBM) to simulate physically-based equations describing the fire evolution and its interaction with the environment (e.g., obstacles, wind and temperature). The property of fuel and non-burning objects are defined on the lattice of the computation domain. A temperature field is also incorporated to model the generation of smoke from the fire due to incomplete combustion. The linear and local characteristics of the LBM enable us to accelerate the computation with graphics hardware to reach real-time simulation speed, while the texture splat primitives enable interactive rendering frame rates.
